Short Url Usage
===============

Tag has been optimized to work with Zikula's directory based shorturl system

Urls like

`http://www.mysite.com/tag/strawberries`

can be generated by
1) enabling shorturls
2) enabling 'strip entry point'

if you further choose to 'Do not display module name in short URLs for' => Tag

you will achieve urls that look like

`http://www.mysite.com/strawberries`

both these link styles will direct the user to a list of content items tagged
as such.
