Compliance
==========

In order for a module to be fully compliant* with Tag, it must provide a class
to define its object's Meta information. This is needed because Hook data is not
sufficient to supply additional needed information such as object title, date
and author.

*If a module is not fully compliant, a link to the object will still be provided
but it is quite generic and looks something like this:

`ModuleName item (id#XXXX)`

Non-compliant modules will display tagged objects **regardless** of permission
and visibility checks within the target module!


Requirements
============

Add a class to your module called `ModuleName_TaggedObjectMeta_ModuleName`

This class must extend `Tag_AbstractTaggedObjectMeta`

Within this class, the interface requires the definition of three methods:

    setObjectTitle($title);
    setObjectDate($date);
    setObjectAuthor($author);

Use these methods to set the associated class properties (title, date, author)
and define the full link used when displaying content Object links.

You must define a constructor and it **must** call it's parent constructor as
well as calling the three methods defining title, date and author.

Date and author items may be defined as empty strings, but the title is required.

You must do your own permission and visibility checks within your plugin.
Tag will return all tagged objects regardless or these checks. If the item
should not be displayed due to checks, simply do not set the title property and
it will not be displayed.


Optional
========

If you wish, you may change how the link is displayed by overriding the 
`getPresentationLink()` method.


Examples
========

Plugins have been implemented in the following modules and may serve as an
example to you in your own development:

  - News
  - Pages
  - Content
  - PostCalendar
