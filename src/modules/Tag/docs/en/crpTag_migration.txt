crpTag Migration
================

Tag will migrate existing tags from crpTag into Tag.

The migration does not require the actual crpTag module, only the existing tables.

To perform the migration, simply click the link in the Admin toolbar. You may
only run the migration once.

In the migration, all existing crpTag tags are imported and all relationships
with their related objects are maintained. Some assumptions are made regarding
the hook areaId because this did not exist before Zikula version 1.3. In
addition, the url for the object is generalized because this information is not
readily available at the time of migration. This effect is minimal because in
the display of the object url, the link is recalculated at the time of display
for most modules.

When the migration is complete, you can safely delete the crpTag tables in your
database (*prefix*_crptag and *prefix*_crptag_archive).
